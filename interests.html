		<!--Interests Overview-->
		<h2>Interests Overview --</h2>
		<div class = "content even"> 
			It's hard to describe my interests and what I am interested in, because I am generally interested in 
			anything and everything that isn't 'shallow'. What I find is that I am more interested in anything new that 
			poses somewhat of a challenge instead [Like most people I think.]
			<br><br>
			Some of my interests [in the general spectrum] that might be elaborated on include
			<ul>
				<li>Science [One of the first topics I was introduced to]</li>
				<li>Music [Already explored in <a href = "hobbies.html">hobbies</a>]</li>
				<li>Mythology</li>
				<li>Literally Everything</li>
			</ul>

		<!--Wildlife-->
		<h2>Wildlife --</h2>
		<div class = "content odd">
			They were the first thing I've ever read about, and all of my younger years were filled with facts and information
			about them.
			<br><br>
			I'm not really sure why, I just become really excited whenever I catch a glimpse of an animal. They're so 
			fascinating to study, with so many different behaviours and functions in their bodies. It's also really fun to 
			watch something you've read in a book being proven to you in real life. I rarely see animals in the city, with
			the exceptions of different squirrel species, raccons, robins, and a few other bid species.
			<br><br>
			I'm also interested in the flora side of wildlife, all the plants and herbs there are. They have so many different
			medicinal and dangerous properties that it's exhilarating to study them , and tehn seek them out in the wild. What I
			hope for is to one day find and observe the plant properties.

		<h2>Psychology --</h2>
		<div class = "content even">

			<img src = "images/psychology.jpg" height = "400" width = "800" id = "psychology" alt = "psychology chart">
			<br>Psychology is an interesting subject because it allows [sort of in a way] <br><br>someone to understand more and have a 
			better grasp on why <br><br>other people made the choice they made, or acted the way <br><br>they did. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			It is also particularly thought-provoking and engaging because <br><br>whenever you learn something psychological, 
			the same <br><br>concept also applies to the learner.
